/*
Key functionalities:

- Joining the network: A node sends a NET_GET_NODE PDU to the tracker to get an entry point into the network.
  If it is the first node, it initializes the network.

- Maintaining connections: Nodes maintain TCP connections with their predecessor and successor nodes.

- Handling data: Nodes can insert, remove, and lookup data entries. They forward requests to the appropriate node if necessary.

- Alive messages: Nodes periodically send NET_ALIVE messages to the tracker to indicate they are still active.
*/

/*
    Create a Tracker Communication Module:
        Write a basic UDP client to send/receive PDUs to/from the tracker.
        Implement STUN_LOOKUP to get the public address.
        Implement NET_GET_NODE to get information about other nodes.

*/


/*
Steps:
-Implement sockets
-STUN_LOOKUP in order to test communication with the tracker
